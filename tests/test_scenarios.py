"""
Behavioral test scenarios for the IASC donor analytics tool.

These tests send natural language questions through the full pipeline
(Claude API + tool use + data queries) and check that responses meet
basic quality criteria.

IMPORTANT: These tests make real API calls and cost money (~$0.01-0.05 each).
Run selectively during development:
    pytest tests/test_scenarios.py -v -k "top_donors"  # single scenario
    pytest tests/ -k "not llm"                          # skip all LLM tests

All tests in this module are marked with the "llm" pytest mark. To exclude
them from a test run, use:
    pytest tests/ -k "not llm"
